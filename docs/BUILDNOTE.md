# Build Note : Create Muscle Tracker App

## Step 1: Create React App with Webpack

To start this projet, I use these documentations : 
- https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-create-a-react-application-with-webpack (Tutorial)
- https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/ (Official Doc)

The goal is to avoid using the `create-react-app` command to understand the tools used to create a project.

## Step 2: Prepare Config to split Frontend & Backend

To split the project, I use this documentation  : 
 - https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-simultaneously-run-the-client-and-server-of-your-full-stack-app-in-one-folder-ef5a988d56d7 (Tutorial)
